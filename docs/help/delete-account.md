## I'm unable to access my account, how can I delete it? 

If you're unable to delete the account from inside the game, you can proceed to send us a message to the following address:

> <support@culto.media>

Indicate that you want to delete your Little Arctic account and provide us with all the relevant information about your account that you can gather, like UID, username, email or any linked accounts. We will get in touch with you and continue the process from there.

## What happens after I delete my account?

All of your player information, stats, inventory and purchases will be removed from our servers. Even if you create a new account with the same credentials, you wont be able to recover anything, not even in-game purchases made with real money. All of your personal information, including details retrieved form third party providers like facebook, apple or google will no longer be accessible by ourselves or any of our third party service providers.
