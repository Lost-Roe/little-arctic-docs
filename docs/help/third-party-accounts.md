# THIRD PARTY ACCOUNTS

You can link different third party accounts to your Little Arctic account. Doing so will provide backup methods for accessing your player profile in case you want to play on a different device. 

## Connect a third party account

You can link your Facebook account and, depending if you are playing on an Android or iOS device, you can choose to connect your Google Play Games or Apple account.

Follow the steps bellow for the service that you wish to associate:

## Disconnect a third party account

If you wish to unlink any of your third party accounts, you can do so from inside the game. This will remove from our servers all of the data associated to that service. 

> [!TIP]
> Remember to always have at least one authentication method for accessing your account, either a third party service like the ones described above or an email address. Otherwise you wont be able to log back in!
